# BSPD (Brake System Plausibility Device) Documentation

## Overview

The Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) is a safety-critical circuit required by Formula SAE rules. It monitors driver inputs to detect implausible conditions (for example, brake + torque request simultaneously) and sensor fault conditions (open/short). When a fault condition is detected, the BSPD opens the shutdown circuit to disable the tractive system and latches the fault until a manual reset.

## High-Level Functional Description

### Purpose

The BSPD ensures vehicle safety by:

1. Detecting simultaneous braking + torque request (implausibility)
2. Detecting sensor open-circuit faults
3. Detecting sensor short-circuit faults
4. Latching any detected fault until a manual reset (via latch board)

### Operating Principle (2026.3 Naming)

The circuit continuously monitors two analog channels:

- **BRAKE** channel (brake pedal sensor)
- **CURRENT** channel (renamed from `PEDAL`; represents the second analog plausibility channel)

External inputs (connectors):

- `B_IN` conditioned into internal net `BRAKE`
- `C_IN` conditioned into internal net `CURRENT`

Threshold comparators generate:

- `BRAKE_APPLIED` (brake above threshold)
- `P_APPLIED` / `PEDAL_APPLIED` (legacy naming in schematic/netlist; corresponds to CURRENT channel applied)

When both channels are simultaneously asserted, `BOTH_ON` becomes true and triggers a fault (with intentional time delay/filtering).

---

## Circuit Architecture (Organized Schematic Stages)

### Stage 1 - Input Conditioning

- Series input resistors on both channels (for example, `B_IN` to `R20` to `BRAKE`, `C_IN` to `R19` to `CURRENT`)
- RC filtering capacitors on the inputs for noise suppression
- Input pulldown resistors added in v2026.3:
  - `BRAKE` to GND via high-value pulldown
  - `CURRENT` to GND via high-value pulldown

These reduce floating-input behavior and improve open-circuit detectability.

### Stage 2 - Threshold Generation (Adjustable)

Trimmer potentiometers (reduced size in v2026.3) generate:

- `BRAKE_THRESHOLD`
- `PEDAL_TH` (legacy net name; corresponds to CURRENT threshold)

### Stage 3 - Comparators

LM393 comparators generate digital status signals:

- Applied detection (`BRAKE_APPLIED`, `P_APPLIED`)
- Open-circuit detection (`B_OPEN`, `P_OPEN`)
- Short-circuit detection (`B_SHORT`, `P_SHORT`)

Comparator outputs feed the fault logic stage.

### Stage 4 - Fault Detection Logic

- Plausibility fault: `BOTH_ON` asserts when brake + current channel are simultaneously above thresholds.
- Open/short faults: open and short comparators assert their respective nets.
- Delay behavior: `BOTH_ON` includes a deliberate RC timing network (approximately 400 ms class behavior) so brief transients do not immediately trip.

### Stage 5 - Fault Aggregation

- OR logic aggregates brake-side faults into `B_ERROR`
- OR logic aggregates current-side faults into `P_ERROR`
- Higher-level OR aggregation yields `FAULT_SENSED` (any fault)

### Stage 6 - Output Conditioning / Latch Interface

Schmitt-trigger inverter stage (40106) provides clean edges and optional latch interfacing depending on system integration.

- Output net: `BSPD_FAULT`
- Two bypass resistors were added to allow bypassing the Schmitt trigger if it is not useful in the final integration.

### Stage 7 - Power Switching

MOSFET output stage drives shutdown circuit behavior as designed (fault forces shutdown state).

### Stage 8 - Debug / Bring-Up Indicators (NEW in v2026.3)

Three debug LEDs were added. They illuminate on key fault states:

- `B_ERROR` (brake error LED1)
- `P_ERROR` (current-channel error LED2)
- `BOTH_ON` (simultaneous application LED3)

## Design Considerations (2026.3)

### LED Drive Decision (No Extra MOSFET for Debug LEDs)

Indicator LEDs are normally driven through a transistor/MOSFET to avoid loading a logic output. In this design, the debug LEDs are intentionally low-current and are used only as status indicators (non-safety-critical).

The CD4081 output stage can source on the order of approximately 1-3 mA at high VDD (datasheet: >=1.3 mA min, approximately 2.6 mA typ at VDD = 10 V, and higher at 12 V), which is sufficient for modern high-efficiency LEDs operated at approximately 1-2 mA.

Series resistors are selected to limit LED current to <= approximately 2 mA across supply tolerance, keeping the gate output within its DC drive capability and maintaining valid logic levels. Omitting a MOSFET reduces BOM count, board area, and routing complexity while still providing clear visual fault indication.

Current implementation note:

- `R22`, `R23`, and `R24` are currently 10k, targeting approximately 1 mA LED current.
- LED forward current capability is 2 mA.
- If brighter indication is needed, these may be changed to 5k (approximately 2 mA target) after test validation.

### Ground/Via Stitching Strategy

Stitching vias were added near decoupling capacitors and around the board perimeter to lower ground impedance at high frequency. Vias placed adjacent to capacitors tie top and bottom ground pours together directly at the point of decoupling, reducing return-path inductance and minimizing supply/ground bounce during fast switching events.

Perimeter stitching forms a "via fence" that better bonds the ground pours and helps contain edge currents, which improves EMI behavior (reduced radiation) and increases noise immunity (reduced susceptibility).

### Component Selection Philosophy

Design preference was to use commonly available parts (especially logic/comparator ICs) and a 12 V-native implementation. A previous concept using higher-performance, more modern 5 V parts was considered, but the performance trade-off was not sufficient to justify the added complexity and availability risk.

### Delay and Fall-Time Network

The `D1`, `R15`, `R14`, and `C7` network is timing-critical. `R` and `C` values must be matched to achieve the intended fault delay and output fall-time behavior. Rules enforce less than 500ms time.

---

## Calibration & Setup

### Threshold Adjustment

Thresholds are adjustable using four trimmers:

- Two trimmers for BRAKE threshold network
- Two trimmers for CURRENT-channel threshold network (legacy net names may still use `PEDAL`)

### Recommended Threshold Targets

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Brake threshold | ~10% travel | Match intended sensor scaling |
| Current-channel threshold | ~25% travel | Match intended scaling for plausibility channel |
| Fault delay | <500 ms | Implemented via RC delay network on plausibility path |

---

## Testing Procedures (Bring-Up)

### Brake Input Test

- Ramp brake input
- Confirm `B_APPLIED` at threshold
- Ensure no fault when other channel is inactive

### Current-Channel Input Test

- Ramp current-channel input
- Confirm `P_APPLIED` at threshold
- Ensure no fault when brake is inactive

### Plausibility Test

- Assert both channels beyond thresholds
- Confirm `BOTH_ON` asserts and then `BSPD_FAULT`
- Verify latch/reset behavior per system integration

### Open Circuit Test

- Disconnect brake input and confirm `B_OPEN` and fault
- Disconnect current input and confirm `P_OPEN` and fault

### Short Circuit Test

- Force brake short condition and confirm `B_SHORT` and fault
- Force current short condition and confirm `P_SHORT` and fault

### Debug LED Confirmation (v2026.3)

Induce each fault type and confirm corresponding LED behavior:

- Brake faults to `B_ERROR` LED1
- Current-channel faults to `P_ERROR` LED2
- Implausibility overlap to `BOTH_ON` LED3
